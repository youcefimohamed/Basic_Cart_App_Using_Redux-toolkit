# Basic_Cart_App_Using_Redux-toolkit


The "Basic Cart App with React-Toolkit" project is a simple cart application developed using React-Toolkit, a React-based library that simplifies state management with Redux. This application allows users to add products to the cart, view the content, and modify quantities. It showcases the use of React-Toolkit's slices to organize state logic in a clear and modular way. Contributions on GitHub are encouraged to enhance existing features and add new functionality. Join this project to gain hands-on experience with React-Toolkit, collaborate with fellow developers, and contribute to a functional and efficient cart application.
